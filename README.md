# To-Do List Application using Queue in Python

## Project Overview
This is a command-line To-Do List Application developed in Python that uses a queue (FIFO) data structure to manage daily tasks. Users can add tasks, mark them as done, view all tasks, or delete all tasks for the day. 

While queues typically enforce a strict First-In First-Out order, this project also demonstrates **flexible task management**, allowing users to conceptually prioritize tasks without breaking the underlying queue logic.

## Features
- Add a task of the day
- Remove a task after completion
- View all current tasks
- Delete all tasks
- Flexible task handling within a queue structure
- Input validation for safer task management

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Python Lists for queue simulation
- Loops and Conditional Statements
- Console-based I/O

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ishanegi5/to-do-list-queue.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd to-do-list-queue
Run the Python file:

bash
Copy code
python todo_list.py
Follow on-screen prompts to add, remove, view, or delete tasks.

Code Structure
Queue class:

enqueue() – Add a new task

dequeue() – Remove a completed task

peek() – Display current tasks

delete() – Delete all tasks

Main loop handles user input and program flow until exit.

Screenshots

If you want, I can **also create a ready-made `todo_list.py` file with your code cleaned up, properly formatted, and ready to upload to GitHub** along with this README.  

Do you want me to do that next?
